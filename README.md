Regression Model Evaluation using R-Squared
This repository contains a regression model and demonstrates how to evaluate its performance using the **R-squared (R²)** metric. R-squared is used to measure how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

## Project Overview

In this project, a regression model is trained on a dataset and evaluated using the R-squared score. The score is calculated by comparing the model's predictions against the true target values from the test set. The R-squared value helps us assess the quality of the model's fit.

## R-Squared Explanation

- **R² = 1** means that the model explains 100% of the variance in the target variable.
- **R² = 0** means that the model does not explain any variance and performs no better than predicting the mean of the target.
- **Negative R²** suggests that the model performs worse than the simplest model (mean prediction).

## How It Works

1. The regression model is trained on a training dataset.
2. The model makes predictions on a test dataset.
3. The R-squared score is calculated to assess how well the model fits the test data.
